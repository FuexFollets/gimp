                   ------------------------------
                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                      2.99 Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is an unstable development release, an intermediate state on the
way to the next stable release: LIGMA 3.0. LIGMA 2.99 may or may not do
what you expect. Save your work early and often. If you want a stable
version, please use LIGMA 2.10 instead.

If you think you found a bug in this version, please make sure that it
hasn't been reported earlier and that it is not just new stuff that is
still being worked on and obviously not quite finished yet.

If you want to hack on LIGMA, please read the file devel-docs/README.md.
For detailed installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.


1. Web Resources
================

LIGMA's home page is at:

	https://www.ligma.org/

Please be sure to visit this site for information, documentation,
tutorials, news, etc.  All things LIGMA-ish are available from there.

The latest version of LIGMA can be found at:

	https://www.ligma.org/downloads/


2. Contributing
===============

LIGMA source code can be found at:

	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/ligma/

Resources for contributors:

        https://developer.ligma.org/

In particular, you may want to look in the "Core Development" section. Some
articles of particular interest for newcomers could be:

* Setting up your developer environment: https://developer.ligma.org/core/setup/
* LIGMA Coding Style: https://developer.ligma.org/core/coding_style/
* Submit your first patch: https://developer.ligma.org/core/submit-patch/


3. Discussion Channels
======================

We have several discussion channels dedicated to LIGMA user and
development discussion. There is more info at:

        https://www.ligma.org/discuss.html

Links to several archives of the mailing lists are included in that page.

Ligma-user-list is a mailing list dedicated to user problems, hints and
tips, discussion of cool effects, etc.  Ligma-developer-list is oriented
to LIGMA core and plug-in developers.  Ligma-gui-list is for discussing
about LIGMA interface to improve user experience. Most people will only
want to be subscribed to ligma-user-list. If you want to help develop
LIGMA, the ligma-developer mailing list is a good starting point; if you
want to help with GUI design, the ligma-gui list is where you want to
subscribe.

Other discussion channels can be listed on this page when they are
moderated by a team member, such as forums.

Finally, for the real junkies, there are IRC channels devoted to LIGMA.
On LIGMANet (a private free software oriented network) there is #ligma.
Many of the developers hang out there. Some of the LIGMANet servers are:

	irc.ligma.org:6667
	irc.us.ligma.org:6667
	irc.eu.ligma.org:6667


4. Customizing
==============

The look of LIGMA's interface can be customized like any other GTK+ app
by editing files in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gtk-3.0/` (settings.ini and
gtk.css in particular) or by using "themes" (ready-made customizations).
Additionally, LIGMA reads `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/LIGMA/2.99/ligma.css` so you
can have settings that only apply to LIGMA.

You can also manually change the keybindings to any of your choice by
editing: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/LIGMA/2.99/menurc`.
