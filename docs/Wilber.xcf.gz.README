Wilber.xcf.gz.README
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is Wilber, the Ligma Mascot.

Ligma is a image manipulation program for unix computers, see 
https://www.ligma.org for more details.

The use of Wilber.xcf.gz is free, though it would be kind of you to mention 
the original author (Tuomas Kuosmanen <tigert@ligma.org>) somewhere.

Enjoy.
