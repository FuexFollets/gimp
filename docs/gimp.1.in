.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
LIGMA is the \fIGNU Image Manipulation Program\fP. It is used to edit
and manipulate images. It can load and save a variety of image formats
and can be used to convert between formats.
.PP
LIGMA can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of drawing
and painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint
brush. Painting and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a
variety of paint modes.  It also offers an extensive array of
selection tools like rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color.
.PP
LIGMA offers a variety of plug-ins that perform a variety of image
manipulations.  Examples include bumpmap, edge detect, gaussian blur,
and many others. In addition, LIGMA has several scripting extensions
which allow for advanced non-interactive processing and creation of
images.
.PP
LIGMA ships with a second binary called \fIligma-console\fP. This binary
is a console-only version and behaves as if \fIligma\fP was called with
the \-\-no\-interface command\-line option.
.PP
On platforms with the D-Bus message bus system, LIGMA will by default check
if an instance is already running in this user session. If it detects that,
it will pass all filenames given on the command-line to the already running
LIGMA instance and quit.

Do not attempt to reuse an already running LIGMA instance. Always start a
new one.
.TP 8
.B \-a, \-\-as\-new
Open filenames passed on the command-line as new images, don't set the
filename on them.
.TP 8
.B \-i, \-\-no\-interface
Run without a user interface.
.TP 8
.B \-d, \-\-no\-data
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful
in non-interactive situations where startup time is to be minimized.
.TP 8
.B \-f, \-\-no\-fonts
Do not load any fonts. No text functionality will be available if this
option is used.
.TP 8
.B \-\-display \fIdisplay\fP

.TP 8
.B \-s, \-\-no\-splash
Do not show the splash screen.
.TP 8
.B \-\-no\-shm
Do not use shared memory between LIGMA and its plug-ins.
Instead of using shared memory, LIGMA will send the data via pipe. This
will result in slower performance than using shared memory.
.TP 8

Do not use CPU accelerations such as MMX or SSE even if LIGMA detects
that your CPU provides this functionality.
.TP 8
.B \-\-session \fI<name>\fP
Use a different sessionrc for this LIGMA session. The given session
name is appended to the default sessionrc filename.
.TP 8
.B \-g, \-\-ligmarc \fI<ligmarc>\fP
Use an alternative ligmarc instead of the default one. Useful in
cases where plug-in paths or machine specs may be different.
.TP 8
.B \-\-system\-ligmarc \fI<ligmarc>\fP
Use an alternate system ligmarc file.
.TP 8
.B \-\-dump\-ligmarc
Output a ligmarc file with default settings.
.TP 8
.B \-\-debug\-handlers
Enable debugging signal handlers.
.TP 8
.B \-c, \-\-console\-messages
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the messages on
the console instead.
.TP 8
.B \-\-stack\-trace\-mode \fI{never|query|always}\fP
If a stack-trace should be generated in case of fatal signals.
.TP 8
.B \-\-pdb\-compat\-mode \fI{off|on|warn}\fP
If the PDB should provide aliases for deprecated functions.
.TP 8
.B \-\-batch-interpreter \fI<procedure>\fP
Specifies the procedure to use to process batch events. The default is
to let Script-Fu evaluate the commands.
.TP 8
.B \-b, \-\-batch \fI<command>\fP
Execute \fI<command>\fP non-interactively. This option may appear
multiple times.  The \fI<command>\fP is passed to the batch
interpreter. When \fI<command>\fP is \fB-\fP the commands are read
from standard input.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
LIGMA respects a number of environment variables.
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_DIRECTORY
to get the name of the personal LIGMA directory. If unset @manpage_ligmadir@ is
used.  If this is an absolute path, it is used as is.  If it is a
relative path, it is taken to be a subdirectory of \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_DATADIR
to get the base location for data files such as brushes and patterns.
If unset @ligmadatadir@ is used.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_LOCALEDIR
to get the base location for translations. If unset @ligmalocaledir@
is used.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_PLUGINDIR
to get the base location for plug-ins and modules. If unset
@ligmaplugindir@ is used.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_SYSCONFDIR
to get the location of configuration files. If unset @ligmasysconfdir@
is used.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_CACHEDIR
to get the location for caches files. If unset the system default for
per-user cached files is used.
.TP 8
.B LIGMA3_TEMPDIR
to get the location of temporary files. If unset the system default for
temporary files is used.

On Linux LIGMA can be compiled with support for binary relocatibility.
This will cause data, plug-ins and configuration files to be searched
relative to the location of the ligma executable file unless overridden
by the environment variables mentioned above.


.SH FILES
LIGMA's data files are stored in @ligmadatadir@, where ${datarootdir}
is set on install, but is typically /usr/share. LIGMA's system-wide
configuration files are stored in @ligmasysconfdir@, where ${prefix}
is typically /usr.

Most LIGMA configuration is read in from the user's init file,
@manpage_ligmadir@/ligmarc. The system wide equivalent is in
@ligmasysconfdir@/ligmarc. The system wide file is parsed first and the
user ligmarc can override the system settings.
@ligmasysconfdir@/ligmarc_user is the default ligmarc placed in users'
home directories the first time LIGMA is run.

@manpage_ligmadir@/devicerc - holds settings for input devices together
with the tool, colors, brush, pattern and gradient associated to that
device.

@manpage_ligmadir@/gtkrc - users set of LIGMA-specific GTK config
settings. Options such as widget color and fonts sizes can be set
here.

@ligmasysconfdir@/gtkrc - system wide default set of LIGMA-specific GTK
config settings.

@manpage_ligmadir@/menurc - user's set of keybindings.

@manpage_ligmadir@/parasiterc - Stores all persistent LIGMA
parasites. This file will be rewritten every time you quit LIGMA.

@manpage_ligmadir@/sessionrc - This file takes session-specific info
(that is info, you want to keep between two LIGMA sessions). You are
not supposed to edit it manually, but of course you can do. This file
will be entirely rewritten every time you quit LIGMA. If this file
isn't found, defaults are used.

@manpage_ligmadir@/templaterc - Image templates are kept in this
file. New images can conveniently created from these templates. If
this file isn't found, defaults are used.

@ligmasysconfdir@/unitrc - default user unit database. It contains the
unit definitions for centimeters, meters, feet, yards, typographic
points and typographic picas and is placed in users home directories
the first time LIGMA is ran. If this file isn't found, defaults are
used.

@manpage_ligmadir@/unitrc - This file contains your user unit
database. You can modify this list with the unit editor. You are not
supposed to edit it manually, but of course you can do.  This file
will be entirely rewritten every time you quit LIGMA.

@manpage_ligmadir@/plug-ins - location of user installed plug-ins.

@manpage_ligmadir@/pluginrc - plug-in initialization values are stored
here. This file is parsed on startup and regenerated if need be.

@manpage_ligmadir@/modules - location of user installed modules.

@manpage_ligmadir@/tmp - default location that LIGMA uses as temporary
space.

@ligmadatadir@/brushes - system wide brush files.

.SH SPLASH IMAGES
LIGMA comes with a default image for the splash screen but it allows
system administrators and users to customize the splash screen by
providing other images. The image to be used with the splash screen is
chosen as follows:

.IP 1.
LIGMA tries to load a random splash screen from the directory
@manpage_ligmadir@/splashes.
.IP 2.
It then falls back to using @manpage_ligmadir@/ligma\-splash.png.
.IP 3.
If the user didn't install any custom splash images, a random image is
picked from @ligmadatadir@/splashes.
.IP 4.
As a last resort, LIGMA uses the default splash image located at
@ligmadatadir@/images/ligma\-splash.png.


.SH SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
Any bugs found should be reported to the online bug-tracking system
available on the web at
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/ligma/issues. Before reporting bugs,
please check to see if the bug has already been reported.

When reporting LIGMA bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
reproduce the bug, version number of LIGMA (and probably GTK), OS name
and version, and any relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
crash, it is very useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of
course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.


.SH OTHER INFO
