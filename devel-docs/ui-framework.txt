  LIGMA UI Framework
  =================

This document describes how the LIGMA UI framework functions and is
implemented. Here, "UI framework" refers to the system that saves the
UI layout between LIGMA sessions, i.e. how docks, dockable dialogs etc
are setup.


  Key Classes
  -----------

LigmaDockable      - Represents a dockable dialog.
LigmaDockbook      - A GtkNotebook of LigmaDockables
LigmaDock          - A columns of LigmaDockbooks
LigmaToolbox       - Subclasses LigmaDock, contains the toolbox.
                    Dockables are added at the bottom
LigmaMenuDock      - Subclasses LigmaDock, contains dockables, should
                    probably be merged with LigmaDock. The name
                    contains "menu" from the time when it hosted the
                    Image Selection Menu that is now in the
                    LigmaDockWindow
LigmaDockColumns   - A set of LigmaDocks arranged side by side.
LigmaDockWindow    - A toplevel window containing a LigmaDockColumns.
LigmaImageWindow   - A toplevel window containing images and one
                    LigmaDockColumns to the left and to the right.
LigmaDialogFactory - A factory to create and position toplevel windows
LigmaSessionInfo   - Contains session info for one toplevel
LigmaUIConfigurer  - Configures the UI when switching between
                    single-window and multi-window mode


  LigmaDialogFactory
  -----------------

The LigmaDialogFactory can be considered to solve two distinct
problems:

1. Create widgets from text, in particular from text in sessionrc
2. Session manage toplevel windows so their position is remembered
   across LIGMA sessions

One possible design adjustment would be to have LigmaWidgetFactory that
takes care of 1), and then have LigmaDialogFactory inherit from
GtkWidgetFactory and implementing 2). LigmaWidgetFactory could possibly
use GtkBuilder.


  sessionrc
  ---------
When LIGMA starts, the sessionrc file is parsed. This step puts
LigmaSessionInfo:s into LigmaDialogFactories. Later when dialogs are
created, the dialog factory looks up existing session info entries. If
one exists, it uses the session info to set e.g. the position of the
created dialog. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new session info
object for the dialog. When LIGMA exists, the current session infos are
then written back to sessionrc.
