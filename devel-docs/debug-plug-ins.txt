Debugging Plug-ins
==================

Eeek! The plug-in you're working on has a bug in it! And the fix isn't
completely obvious, so you want to use a debugger to see what is going on.
But hmm, how does one start a plug-in under a debugger if LIGMA is the one
who is starting the plug-in...

To address this issue, libligma has some hooks controlled by the
LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG environment variable at runtime.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG lets you arrange that a plug-in suspends when it starts,
and then you can start a debugger and attach the debugger to the pid of the
plug-in.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG also lets you arrange for log messages of levels WARNING,
CRITICAL, and ERROR (from the plug-in, LIGMA libraries, and GLib libraries)
to be fatal and generate a backtrace at that point (also called
a stack trace, similar to that generated in a debugger using the 'bt' command.)

When LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG is not defined, depending on how other GLib environment
variables are defined, a plug-in may quietly execute past
warning and critical logged events, and only terminate on a ERROR logged event
(without a backtrace), or on a soft or hard fault such as a memory exception
(possibly producing a core dump that you can examine using a debugger.)


Format of LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG:
----------------------------

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=name<,options>

"name" specifies the name of the plug-in that you wish to debug,
or "all" to debug every plug-in.  See below "Plug-in names".

"options" is zero or more of the following options, separated by :'s

    run:             suspend the plug-in when its run func is called.
    query:           suspend the plug-in when its query func is called.
    init:            suspend the plug-in when its init func is called.
    quit:            suspend  the plug-in when its quit func is called.
    pid:             just print the pid of the plug-in on run_proc.
    fatal-warnings:  similar to "ligma --g-fatal-warnings" on the command line,
                     but for the plugin process
    fw:              shorthand for above.
    fatal-criticals: make CRITICAL level messages fatal (but not WARNING)

In the absence of an options string, only ERRORs are fatal and generate
a backtrace according to stack-trace-mode


To use a debugger on a C-language plug-in:
------------------------------

  0. Ensure LIGMA was built with debugging information (gcc -g)

  1. In a terminal, start LIGMA with the environment variable LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG set
     ( e.g. ">LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,on ligma" )

  2. In another terminal, start a debugger (gdb, lldb, or other) and load the plug-in
     program into the debugger.  Loading only loads the debug symbols.
     ( e.g. ">gdb blur" )

  3. Invoke the plug-in procedure in LIGMA. LIGMA will start the plug-in
     process, then suspend it and print the pid of the plug-in process
     to the terminal where you started LIGMA.

  4. In the debugger, attach to the pid of the plug-in process.
     (e.g. "gdb> attach <pid>")
     Expect the debugger to say where the plug-in is suspended.

  5. In the debugger, set breakpoints (or examine memory, or step, etc.)

  6. Windows: resume the plug-in process with "ligma-debug-resume.exe <pid>"

     Linux and Unix-like: the gdb `continue` command might resume the
     attached process. Possibly you will have to send a SIGCONT signal:

         kill -SIGCONT <pid>

  7. In the debugger, enter "continue". Expect the plug-in to resume under
     control of the debugger and pause at breakpoints.
     (e.g. "gdb> continue")



Examples using a debugger:
--------------------------

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur

    When the blur plug-in's run func is called (the run phase),
    LIGMA suspends it and prints to the console:

    (blur:9000): LibLigma-DEBUG: Waiting for debugger...

    9000 is the pid of the new plug-in process. You can start your debugger,
    attach to the plug-in, set breakpoints/watches/etc. and continue from there.
    Using gdb command "continue" will resume the plugin.

    Expect the plugin to execute until it hits a breakpoint or until a WARNING
    or worse event is logged or until a hard fault such as a memory violation.
    Then the debugger will be back in control.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,on
LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,run:fatal-warnings

    Same effect as above.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,pid

    Prints:

    (blur:9000): LibLigma-DEBUG: Here I am!

    This simply prints the pid but doesn't suspend the plug-in. It is a
    convenience for a plug-in having a GUI. The GUI starts up and waits
    for user input.  When you attach, you will find the plug-in waiting
    in the event loop.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,query
LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,init
LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,quit

    Same effect as for "run", but instead libligma suspends the plug-in before
    one of a plugin's phases: query, init, run,  quit
    E.G. when it is queried or init'ed on LIGMA startup.


To get a backtrace for a plug-in in any language:
-------------------------------------------------

  0. Ensure LIGMA (and all libraries you want details for)
     were built with debugging information (gcc -g)

  1. In a terminal, start LIGMA with the environment variable LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG set
     ( e.g. ">LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=all,fatal-criticals ligma" )
     Expect LIGMA to start normally.

  2. In LIGMA, do something that would invoke a plugin.

     Whenever the specified plug-in processes generate log events of
     the specified levels or worse, libligma will print or offer to print
     (depends on stack-trace-mode) a backtrace, and then terminate the plug-in.
     The LIGMA app will usually continue to run.

For interpreted language plug-ins, the backtrace will include many frames
from the interpreter and modules such as PyGObject.  Exceptions in the
interpreted language may print on their own and not generate log events
to be caught by LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG. But log events from the interpreter
calling out (to LibLigma and GLib) can generate backtraces.


LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG and stack-trace-mode
--------------------------------------

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=all,fatal-warning only makes the machinery *consider*
generating a backtrace, for more log events.  The 'stack-trace-mode' pertains.

The LIGMA app on the command line takes a flag:

    --stack-trace-mode [never, query, always]

When the LIGMA app forks a plugin process, it passes that arg to the plugin,
and the arg controls how a backtrace is printed.

The default is "query", which means libligma will ask you:
"[E]xit [S]tacktrace [P]roceed"
(similar to the GLib default handler for ERROR log events.)

"always" means libligma prints a backtrace (and then the plugin terminates.)

"never" means libligma does not print a backtrace, only a message. But for
LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=all,fatal-warning, the plugin terminates on the first WARNING.


Examples getting a backtrace on logged events:
--------------------------------------------

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=blur,fatal-warnings

    The blur plug-in will run until the first logged WARNING or worse,
    from the plug-in, LIGMA libraries, or GLib libraries.
    Then a backtrace can print to the console and the blur plug-in terminate.
    Usually you will also see a message from the main LIGMA app
    saying the plugin aborted without returning a value.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=all,fatal-criticals

    Every plug-in (whether you invoked it from the LIGMA GUI or it was called
    by another plug-in) will run until the first logged CRITICAL or worse,
    from the plug-in, LIGMA libraries, or GLib libraries.
    Then, as above, a backtrace can print etc.

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG=all

    As above, for all plugins, but only for a logged ERROR.


Quality of a backtrace
----------------------

A detailed backtrace depends on:

1) building LIGMA and dependencies with debug info enabled
2) having a debugger installed

When a debugger is not installed, a backtrace may lack details such as
function names and line numbers.


More about logging levels
-------------------------

See https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Message-Logging.html

   Level      Engendered by
   -----------------------
   WARNING    g_warning().
   CRITICAL   g_return_value_if_fail() or g_return_if_fail().
   ERROR      g_assert() or g_error().

Use of logging levels is by convention, and libraries that LIGMA uses may not
follow conventions.

Generally speaking...

WARNINGs are common but don't signify much.  They might mean that your plug-in
code does not understand, or is sloppy with, the LIGMA API.

CRITICALs are rare but more significant.  They usually mean that LIGMA will
attempt to continue past an errant condition.  The GLib function
g_return_value_if_fail() is often used in LIGMA code as a precondition,
required to succeed before a LIGMA function executes its body,
the function returning early when the precondition fails.

ERRORs are usually dire.  They always terminate a plug-in.



Plug-in names
-------------

A plug-in may register many PDB procedures.  Use the plug-in name, not a
procedure-name, e.g. "file-psd" not "file-psd-save".  When a plug-in is "run",
one of its PDB procedures is run, and all of its PDB procedures
are covered by a LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG definition.

A name is usually the name of the executable file, including any suffix.
Examples: "file-psd" or "foggify.py" or on some platforms "foo.exe."

Usually an interpreted plug-in has a hashbang on the first line
e.g. "#!/usr/bin/env python3" in the first line of foo.py.
Then the file is executable, LIGMA forks that file, and the Linux loader
invokes the interpreter.

However, LIGMA still allows a plug-in source
to lack a hashbang (and it is not technically "an executable")
but then LIGMA forks the interpreter, passing the script filename.
In this case, you must still use the name of the script file e.g. "foo.py"
in LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG.

(Since forever, LIGMA does not understand Python packages.
LIGMA only installs Python plugins from directories named like foo/foo.py.
A directory that is a Python package (having an __init__.py file)
will be read by LIGMA at startup, but LIGMA will only install one plugin
from that directory, and only if the .py file is named like the directory.)


Finding plug-in source by name
------------------------------

A LIGMA supported C language plug-in's source should be in a similar-named
directory in the LIGMA repository.  For example, "file-psd" is a directory
(but there is no "file-psd.c".)

An interpreted plug-in is *installed* in a directory of a similar name
e.g. "plug-ins/foggify/foggify.py".
But in the LIGMA repository, foggify.py does not live at foggify/foggify.py
but at plug-ins/python/foggify.py .



Examples using other debug tools:
---------------------------------

Hmm, but what about memory debuggers such as valgrind or purify? For those
you can set the following:

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG_WRAP=name<,options>

    This is similar to LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG. Only "query", "init", and "run"
    are valid, and "on" defaults to simply "run"

LIGMA_PLUGIN_DEBUG_WRAPPER=debugger

    debugger refers to the debugger program, such as valgrind. You can
    put command line options here too, they will be parsed like they do
    in the shell.


Windows:
--------

When compiled with Windows, a plug-in process is halted by Windows functions.
It must be resumed externally by invoking ligma-debug-resume.exe <pid>
The plug-ins pid can be found out by invoking ligma-debug-resume.exe
without parameters. It shows the pid of all running processes.
