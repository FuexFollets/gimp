# LIGMA sessionrc
# 
# This file takes session-specific info (that is info, you want to keep
# between two LIGMA sessions).  You are not supposed to edit it manually, but
# of course you can do.  The sessionrc will be entirely rewritten every time
# you quit LIGMA.  If this file isn't found, defaults are used.
